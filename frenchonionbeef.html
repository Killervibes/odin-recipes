        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
        <p>
            This French onion beef and noodle dish tastes like an onion-y beef stroganoff topped with tasty fried onions. It's fancy enough for adults but very approachable for littles, too.

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef stew meat. Cook until well-browned on all sides, stirring once or twice, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer meat from Dutch oven to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the Dutch oven. Add onion and garlic. Cook over medium heat until tender and starting to brown, stirring frequently, about 6 minutes. If needed, add a splash of broth to the Dutch oven. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Return beef to the Dutch oven. Add remaining broth, soup, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, 25 to 30 minutes or until meat is tender</li>
            <li>Whisk together sour cream and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Add about 1/2 cup of hot broth mixture from the Dutch oven to the bowl. Stir to combine. </li>
            <li>Add mixture back to the pot and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add egg noodles to the pot. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes or until noodles and beef are tender.</li>
